# MWB "Market Without Border" Project
## MWB to change the way you shop in Yemen
- It is a platform to contain some of the existing stores on the ground in one store, which saves you time, effort and money in your marketing journey.

  
- What distinguishes MWB:
          - Save time: Do not spend hours moving between stores in the market, as you can browse many stores from your home in MWB.
            Each section on the site can contain several different stores for the same section
            so that the user can compare prices between other stores and choose the best with ease.
          - Saving effort: so that the user can request what he wants and it will be delivered to him.
          - Save money: By comparing prices as mentioned above.
  
- How to work MWB:
          - Find the products you want.
          - Add products to cart.
          - Submit your data and complete the payment process.
          - Your orders are sent to the stores you purchased from.
          - Orders are sent by stores to the address you previously mentioned in your data.

- Note:
      - This site is a small model of the idea,
        and I hope that it will be developed in the future to include more features and provide better services to customers.
